Delaware Workers Comp Annual Loss Costs

http://www.dcrb.com/dcrb/industry-resources/rating-values/dcrb-rating-values/

Components:
- ETL = loads each years loss cost file, cleans, and combines the loss costs into one dataframe object
- EDA = scripts to perform exploratory data analysis

Notes:
- Download the excel files from the DCRB and place them all in the dewclc/etl/ore sub-folder, as this is where the cleaning script will look for the annual files.
